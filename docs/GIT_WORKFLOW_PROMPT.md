I need you to create a complete git workflow for the changes I've made. Here's what I need you to do:

**Context of Changes:**
[DESCRIBE YOUR CHANGES HERE - e.g., "Added task creation feature with quick add input and task list display"]

**Tasks to Execute:**

1. **Create a new branch** with an appropriate name based on the context above (use kebab-case, e.g., feature/task-creation, fix/sidebar-bug, etc.)

2. **Stage all changes** using `git add .`

3. **Create a commit message** following these conventions:
   - Use conventional commits format: `type(scope): description`
   - Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore
   - Keep first line under 72 characters
   - Add detailed body if changes are complex
   - Reference any ticket numbers if applicable

4. **Push the branch** to origin

5. **Create a pull request** to merge into `master` with:
   - A clear title summarizing the changes
   - Description that includes: what changed, why it changed, and how to test
   - Any relevant screenshots or context

Please execute these steps sequentially and confirm each step's success before moving to the next. If any step fails, stop and report the error.
